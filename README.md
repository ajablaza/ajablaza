# 👋 Hi, I’m Aprylle (ajablaza)

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!  
I’m currently completing my **Master of Information Technology**, specializing in **Cybersecurity** 🔐.

I’ve always been drawn to technology and problem-solving, and over the years I’ve independently explored **web development**, backend systems, and secure coding practices. This profile serves as a central hub for my projects, labs, and experiments as I grow into a well-rounded IT and cybersecurity professional.

## 🔍 What I’m Up To Right Now

🔭 I’m currently documenting my **ethical hacking lab** into clean, structured documentation that I can easily review and build upon in the future.

🌱 I’m actively revamping **BreachBox**, a deliberately vulnerable web application used to practice **secure coding** and experiment with **SAST** and **DAST** tools in a controlled environment.

👯 I’m interested in collaborating on beginner-friendly cybersecurity labs, vulnerable app projects, or tooling that makes security concepts easier to understand.

💬 Ask me about ethical hacking labs, web application security, backend development, or how I break down complex technical topics step by step. Happy to discuss ideas with others!

⚡ Fun fact: I am a huge fanatic of Dungeons and Dragons content. Oftentimes, I am found listening to DnD podcasts while playing video games.
